UnifiedPush is a specification and set of tools to let the user choose how push notifications are delivered. All in a free and open source way.

End users should look at setting up a [distributor](/users/distributors/).
Developers wanting to integrate UnifiedPush in their apps should look at the [definitions](/spec/definitions) and the documentation for your [platform](/developers/).
