You are a user, you don't care about Google, you just want it works ? Then look at the download links of [fcm-distributor](/users/distributors/fcm). \*

## Your solution

The applications that gives notifications is called a Distributor, to set up one, you should look at the [Distributor page](/users/distributors/).
