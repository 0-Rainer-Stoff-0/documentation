This documentation is for application developpers who want to use the UnifiedPush library.

If you want to write a new distributor, please refere the [definitions](/spec/definitions/) and the [specifications](/spec/android/). You may also want to look at the code of [NoProvider2Push](/users/distributors/np2p/), which is mostly only UnifiedPush related code.
