## TLDR

### Gotify

Gotify works with a server.

Right now Gotify is UnifiedPush's primary distributor. There is a public server and more information available on the [Gotify page](./gotify.md)

### NoProvider2Push

NoProvider2Push needs a static IP to work, which is reachable with a VPN or public meshing network.

### UP-FCM Distributor

Firebase Cloud Message is Google's push notification service. You won't need anything else to use it.
