## TLDR

#### Gotify

Gotify works with a server. 

At this moment there is not any public server (open to registration) but you can ask on the matrix chat (or IRC) if someone want to accept you on her/his server or self-host it. 


#### NoProvider2Push

NoProvider2Push needs a static IP to work, which is reachable with a VPN or public meshing network.

#### UP-FCM Distributor

Firebase Cloud Message is Google's push notification service. You won't need anything else to use it.
